# Minimalist-Geeky

This geeky theme is hacked and derived from the Minimalist theme. Here is the original README stuff and pointers:

Minimalist is a responsive theme with a focus on blogging based on the [Minimalistic](https://github.com/rriegger/MinimalisticBlogTheme) Ghost theme made by [Raphael Riegger](https://github.com/rriegger). Noteworthy features of this Hugo theme are the integration of a comment-system powered by Disqus, easy localization (l10n), support for RSS feeds, syntax highlighting for source code and sharing options in the blog posts.
