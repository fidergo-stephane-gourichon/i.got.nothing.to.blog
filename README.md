## Code source for the weblog i.got.nothing.to.blog

To check that everything is compiling alright:

    % hugo check

To deploy onto a site:

    % hugo -d $ROOT_WWW

You'll need to [install hugo first](https://gohugo.io/overview/installing/), though.

You'll find all the posts in the `content` directory. If you find any typo or spelling
mistake, don't hesitate to open an issue or write a PR! â˜º

The images featured on those posts are in the `static/img` directory.
