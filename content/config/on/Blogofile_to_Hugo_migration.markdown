It's been a long time since I last posted on that blog. Besides the fact that I've 
been too busy to update it, it's also because it was stuck in 2009.

When I first heard of the concept of *static site generator* I was very
excited, so I used the first tool that existed â€” [Blogofile]. I hacked together
a site, made nice looking URL (on the `nothing.to/do` schemeÂ ðŸ˜‰) , and made my
site xhtml 1.0 compliant (as was the hype at the time), and integrated my
existing dotclear theme into blogofile's templates. 

[![The site as it was last yesterday](/img/nothing-to-blog-legacy.png)](http://web.archive.org/web/20160401154950/http://i.got.nothing.to/blog/)

But since 2009, a lot of things changed. HTML5/CSS3 has taken over the world,
displays' resolution got much better and the kind and screen size of devices on
which you look at a website became a lot more diversified. The adaptive design
looks were'nt fit anymoreâ€¦ So what was then a comfortable and easy to read
blog, became an unreadable ugly website in just a few years. Thus an upgrade of
the look'n feel was needed.

Then another issue appeared, since I developed the first version of my blog, I kept
it up to date with blogofile with ease. But many parts of blogofile broke between
v0.7 and v0.8, meaning that upgrading the engine would mean a major rewrite of the
code. That made me consider engine alternativesâ€¦

Not long before I decided to revamp my blog, [my friend Dimitri](https://dmerej.info/) 
told me how happy he was using [Hugo]. I also considered other options, from
[Pelican] to [Jekyll]. What eventually drove me towards [Hugo] has been that it
featured a hundred of modern-looking themes, and that I was curious about
discovering The [Go language], on which I had good feedback.

And there I was, following the quickstart to compile and install the tool,
browsed through the hundred themes to find the one that met the minimal
requirements I had â€”Â non-compiled CSS, responsive design, focused on reading
comfort, and with a hack friendly license. So, the one I found matching most of
those criterias was minimalist's theme from [@rriegger] as adapted to [Hugo] by
[@digitalcraftsman].

[![Original theme](/img/hugo-minimalist-theme.png)](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-minimalist-theme)

And there the fun begun. I took all my old markdown files and moved them in the
content folder. I've patched them to add the [aliases] parameter, so I could make sure
I wouldn't break the web, switched from the odd old `$$code` format for codes, to have
proper original markdown support (I would still need to choose an [highlighting strategy]
at some point), and that was done.

Then I went on to hack the theme to make the site header smaller, remove the "about"
part on the left of the articles â€”Â this blog really is about my hacks â€” and moved
the social-stuff icons to the top right, so they're there but not in the way. Doing
so, I had some fun implementing the blinking cursor (because [<span class="blink">`<blink>`</span> forever!](/img/userfriendly.org-blink.gif))
and give it the same look my old Amstrad CPC6128 had.

[![CPC6128](/img/amstrad-cpc6128.jpeg)](http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/2666/Amstrad-CPC-6128/)

So after some google search, I found a neat tip to make [neon glow], that once
a bit reduced would make a perfect case for CRT glow. Then I made the
background having some green halo, to feel like the old bubbly CRT of the
Amstrad, using a [radial gradient] as `background` property of the header. I
also wanted to give the same texture that old CRT add, so I borrowed from
[that demo](http://codepen.io/lbebber/pen/XJRdrV/) the pixel lines overlay (but
skipped on the flicker and on/off effectsâ€¦ as it'd be a bit too much â˜º)
Finally, I found an [Amstrad font] look alike on Fonts2u by Wesley Clarke, who
made it free to use.

I finally hacked together the [tag cloud](/tags), using a [CSS hack], added the path
within the blog within the [navigation partial]. And I was almost doneâ€¦

Almost, because I ran into a [huge issue], as reported on the hugo's forum. My
problem was that either I root my blog at `/blog` and all my URL are like
`i.got.nothing.to/blog/hack/on/stuff`, or I don't and the default URL is
`i.got.nothing.to/` and then the URL are like `i.got.nothing.to/hack/on/stuff`.
What should have been an easy change, became a major wall I hit.

[I finally solved] that issue by adding a `blog` section, and a single post that will
get ignored, and which will list all data. Then, I made the index page a redirect
to the `/blog` path. And it was [almost](https://github.com/guyzmo/i.got.nothing.to.blog/commit/215fd1c05d42a22be6e647673464c296b725b635) done!

So now, I'm happily blogging again, thanks to that blog propelled by the hamster in
a wheel!
