At the 2010's RMLL in Bordeaux, I shared a stand and workshop
with John Lejeune, Jimmie P. Rodgers and Mitch Altman. After
some time hacking on a python clone of Yaler that will soon
be released and posted, I had the idea to hack the LoL shield
so it can display any string sent through the serial port.

The hack has been done during the RMLL, and released as is.
There are still some bugs and improvement to be done so it
can be really useful, see the README and the code on my
[github](https://github.com/guyzmo/LoL-shield-dynamic-banner) for more.

_Disclaimer: I'm definitively not a fan of arduinos, but if I
can help nice people to bring more usages of their projects,
I'm glad to do it ;)_
